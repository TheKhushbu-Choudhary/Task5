## 🛠 Technologies Used

- **HTML5**: Semantic markup with accessibility features
- **CSS3**: Modern CSS with custom properties, Grid, Flexbox

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Clone or download the project**
   ```bash
   git clone [repository-url]
   cd modernshop
   ```

2. **Serve the files**
   - Use a local server (required for service worker):
   ```bash
   # Using Python
   python -m http.server 8000
   
   # Using Node.js
   npx http-server
   
   # Using Live Server (VS Code extension)
   # Right-click on index.html and select "Open with Live Server"
   ```

3. **Access the application**
   - Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`
   - The application will automatically cache for offline use

## 🎨 Customization

### Theming
The application uses CSS custom properties for easy theming:

```css
:root {
    --primary-color: #007bff;
    --secondary-color: #6c757d;
    --success-color: #28a745;
    /* Add more custom properties */
}
```

### Adding Products
Modify the `getMockProducts()` function in `js/main.js` to add or change products:

```javascript
{
    id: 9,
    name: "New Product",
    price: 99.99,
    category: "electronics",
    image: "path/to/image.jpg",
    rating: 4.5,
    reviews: 100,
    description: "Product description"
}
```

### Configuration
Key configuration options in `js/main.js`:

```javascript
this.productsPerPage = 12;  // Products per page
this.isLoading = false;     // Loading state
```
